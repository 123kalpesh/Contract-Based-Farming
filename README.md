# Contract-Based-Farming
ğŸŒ¾ Contract-Based Farming Contract-Based Farming is a strategic agricultural model where farmers enter into agreements with buyersâ€”such as companies, cooperatives, or exportersâ€”before the crop is planted. This system ensures mutual benefits: farmers gain assured markets and financial support, while buyers secure consistent quality and supply.
